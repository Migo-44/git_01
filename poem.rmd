## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

In a Wonderland they lie,  
Dreaming as the days go by,       
Dreaming as the summers die:  
Ever drifting down the stream   
Lingering in the golden gleam

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

Her eyes, like oceans, deep and blue,     
Reflect the sky, the morning dew.    
Soft as whispers, they gleam and shine,    
A gentle gaze, so pure, divine.     

Her hair, a stream of chestnut brown,    
Flows like autumn leaves falling down.    
Each strand, a story, rich and bright,  
Catching sunlight, soft and light.   

With every glance, the world stands still,    
A quiet grace, a silent thrill.     
Her laughter echoes in the air,     
A melody beyond compare.     

In those blue eyes, the stars align,   
A galaxy of thought and time.      
And in her hair, the winds do play,   
Guiding dreams both night and day.   

She moves like whispers through the breeze,   
With beauty that puts hearts at ease.
