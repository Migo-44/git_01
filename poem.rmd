## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

In a Wonderland they lie,  
Dreaming as the days go by,       
Dreaming as the summers die:  
Ever drifting down the stream   
Lingering in the golden gleam  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,  
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,  
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;  
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.  
The work of hunters is another thing:    

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,   
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make   
      The billows smooth and bright —      
And this was odd, because it was   
      The middle of the night.   

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun   
Had got no business to be there    
      After the day was done —     
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."     

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

Her eyes, like oceans, deep and blue,     
Reflect the sky, the morning dew.    
Soft as whispers, they gleam and shine,    
A gentle gaze, so pure, divine.     

Her hair, a stream of chestnut brown,    
Flows like autumn leaves falling down.    
Each strand, a story, rich and bright,  
Catching sunlight, soft and light.   

With every glance, the world stands still,    
A quiet grace, a silent thrill.     
Her laughter echoes in the air,     
A melody beyond compare.     

In those blue eyes, the stars align,   
A galaxy of thought and time.      
And in her hair, the winds do play,   
Guiding dreams both night and day.   

She moves like whispers through the breeze,   
With beauty that puts hearts at ease.
